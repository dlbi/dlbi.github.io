While initially applied for detecting facial nerve palsy (FNP), these parameters hold promise as reliable, objective metrics for diagnosing FNP, complementing facial asymmetry features explored in other studies. To further enhance the performance of eyelid keypoint detection (EKD) models, we also introduce a long-term active learning (AL) framework. This framework is designed to select the minimum number of frames for annotation from an expanding unlabeled pool, maximizing model performance for practical applications while minimizing annotation effort.",
