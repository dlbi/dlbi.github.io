This approach aims to minimize the reliance on expensive segmentation annotations by neuroradiologists. Additionally, we are now working with two deep learning models that can directly classify brain CT scans without requiring segmentation, enabling efficient and accurate detection of NPH and other brain conditions. This shift represents a significant step toward streamlined, cost-effective diagnostic workflows in neuroimaging.",

These algorithms derive objective blinking parameters for each blink, which can be analyzed to train machine learning models. While initially applied for detecting facial nerve palsy (FNP), these parameters hold promise as reliable, objective metrics for diagnosing FNP, complementing facial asymmetry features explored in other studies. To further enhance the performance of eyelid keypoint detection (EKD) models, we also introduce a long-term active learning (AL) framework. This framework is designed to select the minimum number of frames for annotation from an expanding unlabeled pool, maximizing model performance for practical applications while minimizing annotation effort.",

The model uses contrastive learning to extract distinct features from sequences of sky exposures, combined with additional learned features for accurate detection. This approach enables automated asteroid detection and complements existing software by identifying additional candidates.",
